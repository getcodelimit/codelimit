# Quickstart

Depending on your development workflow, Code Limit can run as:

- [Pre-commit hook](#pre-commit-hook)
- [GitHub Action](#github-action)
- Standalone
  - [Homebrew](#homebrew-install)
  - [Pipx](#pipx-install)
  - [Pypi](#pypi-install)
  - [Platform binary](#platform-binaries)

## Pre-commit hook

Code Limit can be installed as a [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) hook so
it alarms you during development when it's time to refactor:

```yaml
-   repo: https://github.com/getcodelimit/codelimit
    rev: 0.6.2
    hooks:
    - id: codelimit
```

Code Limit is intended to be used alongside formatting, linters and other hooks
that improve the consistency and quality of your code (such as
[Black](https://github.com/psf/black),
[Ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff) and
[MyPy](https://github.com/python/mypy).) As an example pre-commit configuration
see the
[`pre-commit-config.yaml`](https://github.com/getcodelimit/codelimit/blob/main/.pre-commit-config.yaml)
from Code Limit itself.

When running as a hook, Code Limit *warns* about functions that *should* be
refactored and *fails* for functions that *need* to be refactord.

To show your project uses Code Limit place this badge in the README markdown:

## GitHub Action

Code Limit is available as a GitHub Action

To run Code Limit on every push and before every merge to `main`, append it to
your GH Action workflow:

```yaml
name: 'main'
on:
  push:
    branches: main
  pull_request:
    branches: main
jobs:
  ci:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: 'Checkout'
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: 'Run Code Limit'
        uses: getcodelimit/codelimit-action@main
```
